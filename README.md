About Authentiya
Authentiya is a browser extension designed to solve the challenge of maintaining academic integrity in an AI-powered world. With the rise of AI tools, schools are increasingly concerned about student learning and potential plagiarism. Authentiya provides a seamless solution that:

Runs in the background like Grammarly
Offers real-time tracking of AI usage
Provides comprehensive reporting at scale
Integrates with learning management systems
Unlike competitors such as TurnItIn (which works after submission and has accuracy issues) or GPTZero (which lacks LMS integration), Authentiya offers a vigilant and actionable solution that works alongside students and teachers.

Project Features
Student Dashboard: Track writing progress and manage assignments
Document Editor: Write with real-time tracking and citation support
Teacher Dashboard: Monitor student work and identify potential AI usage
Assignment Management: Create, track, and evaluate student assignments
